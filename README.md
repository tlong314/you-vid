# youVid.js

A JavaScript module that extends menu options for web videos on YouTube and similar sites.

For your own projects, just add reference this script after your HTML.

This module is mainly built for viewing other sites though, so visit a website with a video on it, and paste all of youVid.js or youVid.min.js into the web console.

If you do not have access to the console, copy all the text in youVid4url.txt and paste it into your address bar. Then type `javascript:` before it and press Enter.
